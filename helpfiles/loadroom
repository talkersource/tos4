Usage:  ~FG.loadroom <roomname>

This command will load a room into a dynamic room.  If the room
belongs to a user who is currently logged in, this command will
be overrided by the user's presence.  It can also load rooms that
do not belong to any user.  Dynamic room descriptions are stored
in the USERFILES directory with the name Username.R  NOTE:  Loading
rooms requires that there is a free dynamic room, and that dynamic
rooms are allowed.  The room will be destroyed when empty.

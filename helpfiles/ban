Usage:  ~FG.ban site/user/new <site/user name>

This command places a "ban" on a user and/or site.  The different
types are as follows:

        SITE - This will immediately disconnect anyone who attempts
               to connect from the site specified.  It can be in
               numeric IP or alphanumeric DNS form.

        USER - This will disconnect anyone who attempts to login
               with the username that has been banned.  Normally
               the user must be created first before it can be
               banned, but names can be added manually from the shell.

         NEW - This works in the same way as SITE, but only disconnects
               the user if the person attempts to make a new account.
               This is good when you have users from a site that you
               do not want to lock out, but also have people from the
               same site who you don't want making an account.

Usage:  ~FG.cloak none/<level> [<user>]

This command will falsify your level to other users in .people,
.status, and .examine.  You may cloak to any level equal or below
your actual level.  Cloaking has no effect on your actual level and
is reset when you log out or disable it using the "none" option.

If you specify the <user> option, you can cloak another user of
lower rank than yourself.

Usage: afk [lock] [<message>]

This command allows you to set yourself to "away from keyboard" which 
shows up when people "look" at the room and you will pronounced afk if
they try to tell you or pemote something to you. Just press return to
reset unless you have specified the "lock" option will lock your session
and prevent someone using it while you are away from the terminal. Enter
your talker password and press return to unlock it. You can leave an
optional message when you go afk which will be sent to anyone trying
to .tell or .pemote to you.

The talker can store a limited number of private messages sent to you
while you are away.  If a message is sent to you while you are AFK,
the talker will instruct you on how to receive the stored messages.

Usage:  ~FG.debugger <module> [<parameters>]

TalkerOS includes a rarely-used, but nice feature called the Debugger.
Througout different versions of the talker software, many debugger
'modules' will be included.  Each module performs a different function.
To use a module, enter its name as <module> and any <parameters> it may
or may not require.

This version of TalkerOS (v4.03) includes:  3 debugger modules
                                            1 hidden module

        (1) - 'command' module : This module will list all commands in
                                 the system by their virtual 'memory'
                                 location.  This is helpful when attempt-
                                 ing to install new plugins.

        (2) - 'input' module   : This module will copy the current user
                                 and *ALL* inputted text to the SYSLOG.
                                 This is useful when debugging conflicts
                                 that arise when modifying the software.

	(3) - 'plugin' module  : This module lists all installed plugins,
				 their properties, and any/all associated
				 commands that have been added to the
				 command 'memory' map.

        The 'hidden' module will record the last user and his/her
        input when the talker crashes due to error.  This is also
        useful when conflicts arise after new modifications.

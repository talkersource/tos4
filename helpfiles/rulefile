Wilderland Bill of Rights - aka "The Rules"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 1) Be nice.            - 'Nuff said.  Just be kind.  If in
                          doubt, don't.

 2) No racism/prejudice - Your beleifs may not be the same as
                          others'.  Please don't make a big deal
                          over trivial opinions.

 3) No HEAVY swearing.  - This talker was designed for ALL AGES.
                          Please control heavy language as it is
                          impossible to tell someone's real age.

 4) Obey ALL Admins     - You can type .ranks to display a list.
                          If someone with an "ADMIN"-type rank
                          asks you to do something, please do it.

 5) No excessive idling - Please do not idle for too long.  You
                          may be killed if you idle too long.  If
                          you MUST idle, use ~FG.afk~RS so others know.

 6) No obscene behavior - This includes cybersex, any hints,
			  references, suggestions, or other
			  inuendos.  There is ZERO TOLERANCE.

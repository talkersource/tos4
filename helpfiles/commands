Usage:  ~FG.commands [<startLevel>] [<endLevel>/only]

This will list out the commands that you have access to.
You may specify a <startLevel> and an <endLevel> only if
the following conditions are met:

        1)  You are at or below both levels.
        2)  <startLevel> is lower than <endLevel>

Using these options will list only the commands at and
between these levels.  You may also specify the "only"
switch for the <endLevel> if you only want to display
the commands for the <startLevel>.

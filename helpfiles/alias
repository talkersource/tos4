Usage:  ~FG.alias <nickname>

This command will set an alias for yourself that is active for the
current session only.  Other users can use your alias just like your
user name in commands.  This is helpful if your name is similar to
another user's name, or your name is extra-long or hard to type. You
may NOT set the alias to an existing user's name or an alias that is
already in use.  NOTE: If a new user is created and its name is the
same as your alias, your alias will be deactivated.

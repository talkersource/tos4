This command toggles ANSI color off or on.  If your terminal does
not support ANSI color and you receive "junk" on your screen, turn
this command off.  If your terminal DOES support color, turn this
on for the best look.

        See ~FG.help colorcodes~RS for information on how
        to use color in your text, desc, profile, etc.

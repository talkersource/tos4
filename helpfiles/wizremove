Usage:  ~FG.wizremove <user>

This command will remove an administrator at or below your level.
It will only work for WIZARDS and above, not regular users.  It is
designed to force a user to log out if he/she is still logged in,
but doesn't appear to be connected any longer.  The person must be
idle for LONGER than the regular user timeout setting before they
can be removed.

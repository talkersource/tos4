Usage:  ~FG.arrest <user>

This command will move a user to the room specified as JAIL in the
config file and remove all command privlidges.  The *only* action
available to the user will be .say.  This setting is saved with the
user's details, so when they re-login they will automatically be
placed back in jail until released. NOTE:  This function will be
disabled if there are no rooms configured as type JAIL.

This command is level-specific, meaning that the user must be
released by the same or higher level that arrested him/her.

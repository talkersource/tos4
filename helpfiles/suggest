Usage:  ~FG.suggest [<suggestion text>]

This command writes a suggestion to the talker's suggestion board.
It does not matter where you are in the talker.  Use this just like
you would for writing message in room, but write meaningful
suggestions only, please.  If you leave off the suggestion text, you
will be taken into the editor to write up to 15 lines.

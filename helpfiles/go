This command has many options... you can:  Move to a different room,
                                           go to a talker using the netlink.
                                         & return to the main room.

Use ~FG.go~RS by itself to quickly return to the main room from anywhere.
Use ~FG.go <service> [<remote password>]~RS to go across a netlink.
Use ~FG.go <room1> <room2> <room3>. . .<room9>~RS to do a multi-move.

Multi-move allows you to move through up to 9 rooms in one command.
Enter between one and nine room names (separated by spaces).  This allows
you to skip having to type 9 individual .go commands.  The talker will
take you to the last room on your list that you can go to.  You may not
go through private rooms, and each room must be connected to the previous
one.

T a l k e r O S   version 4.03 public release
============================================================================
User file format and layout guide.

NOTE:  This guide is applicable ONLY to version 4.02 or 4.03 with a
       RUNTIME version of "402" or "403" respectively.  Any other
       version(s) may not comply and/or run with this format.
============================================================================

<runtime version>
<password>
<last login> <total time> <last length> <mail read time> <date created>
<level> <muzzled> <arrested> <possessed> <can edit room descriptions>
<prompt> <charecho> <mode> <color> <wizduty> <visibility>

<last site connected from>

<out phrase>
<personal room topic>

<website address>

============================================================================

Manual modification of the userfiles is not recommended.  However, it
may become necessary, so this guide is provided.  Also the ability to
edit regular room descriptions must be set MANUALLY from the shell.
Find the <can edit room descriptions> option and change from 0 to 1
to allow someone this capability.

    VERY IMPORTANT!!!
    -----------------
    NEVER CHANGE the runtime version that is written on the first
    line of each userfile. This number is used by the talker to
    determine whether the userfile is compatible or not.  If it is
    altered, a segmentation fault may occur.  Or the user might
    not be allowed to login.  Old userfiles will AUTOMATICALLY
    be upgraded to a new version once the new version is installed.
    Again, DO NOT change the runtime version.

WHAT DOES THE FIREWALL DO?

        The firewall is a very complex security system for your talker.
        While it is not 100% secure, it can be one of the most valuable
        tools you have against hacking at your talker.  The firewall,
        patterned after server firewalls, will check your administrators
        to make sure they are who they say they are.  It does this by
        checking the admin's name, rank, and site.  If everything matches
        with the stored information, the admin is allowed to continue.
        If there is a mismatch, certain actions can be performed based on
        the system settings.

        The TalkerOS firewall will check every user at a certain level
        and above to make sure they are authorized for an admin level.
        Or, it can check to make sure that the site is authorized. Or,
        it can check to make sure both the name AND site match.  The
        firewall can check up to two sites per user.  This allows each
        user the ablility to have an 'alternate' site and still get in
        without any difficulty.

FIREWALL VIOLATIONS

        When a user who is logging in does not comply with all the
        requirements set in the firewall, a 'Firewall Violation' is
        triggered.  The actions that are then performed depend on the
        settings of the firewall.  The firewall can temporarily demote or
        permanently demote the user.  It can also kill the user if it
        is set to do so.  These settings, as well as what level to demote
        to, are set individually for both a name/level mismatch and a
        user/site mismatch.

MAKING MODIFICATIONS

        For security purposes, it is suggested that the SECURITY.H file
        (which contains the firewall information) be kept on a computer
        other than the talker's server.  This means that it would have
        to be uploaded whenever changes are made to the talker, but it
        would keep any hackers from being able to read or alter the
        security file.  This file is the heart of the firewall, and it
        not only contains the information about authorized users, but
        it also controls the way the firewall operates.  This file
        MUST be present in order to compile the talker, and the talker
        MUST be recompiled whenever changes are made to the SECURITY.H file.

-------------------------------------------------------
 Specific Details About Modifying Each Security Option
-------------------------------------------------------

check_at_lev    -  This sets the level that the firewall begins checking
                   when users login.  The level is set using the level
                   number (see .ranks to find the number for the level
                   you want).  Users who are below this level are NOT
                   checked by the firewall, and there is no security for
                   those levels.

revert_level    -  This sets the numeric (see .ranks) level that a user
                   will be demoted (or temp-demoted) to if his/her name
                   is not authorized for the CHECK_AT_LEV level.

revert_site     -  This sets the numeric level that a user will be demoted
                   (or temp-demoted) to if his/her name does not match one
                   of the sites (up to 2 per user) that has been entered
                   for that username.

allow_local     -  This sets whether the talker will allow anyone to
                   connect from the local server (localhost).  This is
                   universal for ANY user on ANY port (other than LinkPort),
                   and check_at_lev does not apply.  Set this value to
                   one (1) if you wish to allow localhost logins, or to
                   zero (0) if you do not want anyone to be able to.

allow_altsite   -  This sets the ALT_SITE mode of the firewall.  If the
                   setting is zero (0), each user in the firewall has only
                   one site that they may connect from without invoking
                   a firewall violation.  If it is set to one (1), then
                   each user in the firewall may have up to two sites,
                   a main site and an alternate site.

allow_namefail  -  This sets whether you want to require users at the
                   CHECK_AT_LEV level to have their username listed in
                   the firewall.  If this is set to one (1), then each
                   user at or above CHECK_AT_LEV *must* have his/her name
                   installed in the firewall.  If it is set to zero (0),
                   then the firewall does not check the username.

allow_sitefail  -  This sets whether you want to require users in the
                   firewall to be connected from one of the sites listed
                   for that particular user.  If set to one (1), then
                   the user's site/IP must match one of the sites that
                   is listed for that user in the firewall.  If set to
                   zero (0), then the firewall does not check sites.

        IMPORTANT NOTE:  If *both* allow_namefail and allow_sitefail
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   are set to 0, the firewall will be turned 'off'
                         and there will be no security provided.

namefail_temp   -  This selects whether you wish to have a user permanently
                   or temporarily demoted when there is a NAME violation.
                   If set to one(1), then it will be a temporary demotion.
                   If set to zero(0), then it will be permanent.

sitefail_temp   -  This selects whether you wish to have a user permanently
                   or temporarily demoted when there is a SITE violation.
                   If set to one(1), then it will be a temporary demotion.
                   If set to zero(0), then it will be permanent.

namefail_kill   -  This selects whether you wish to have the user auto-
                   matically KILLED when there is a NAME violation.  If
                   set to one(1), the user will be killed.  If set to
                   zero(0), the user will be allowed to stay connected.

sitefail_kill   -  This selects whether you wish to have the user auto-
                   matically KILLED when there is a SITE violation.  If
                   set to one(1), the user will be killed.  If set to
                   zero(0), the user will be allowed to stay connected.

allow_wiz_on_main - This selects whether you wish to allow users that are
                    at or above CHECK_AT_LEV to login on the Main Port.
                    If set to one(1), then wizards can login on either the
                    MainPort or the WizPort.  If set to zero(0), wizards
                    MUST login on the WizPort.

total_fwusers   -  This sets the total number of administrators listed
                   in the firewall.  It is VERY important that this
                   number EXACTLY MATCHES the number of users listed.

*fire_name[]    -  This is the array list of the usernames of every
                   authorized person in the firewall.  Unless
                   allow_namefail is off, each user at or above the
                   CHECK_AT_LEV must be listed here.  The username
                   must be listed EXACTLY as it appears, including
                   *all* capital letters.

*fire_main[]    -  This is the main array list of the sites of every
                   authorized person in the firewall.  Unless
                   allow_sitefail is off, there MUST be a site listed
                   for EVERY user listed in *fire_name[]. The site can
                   be a DNS or a numeric IP.  Be careful with users who
                   have dynamic IPs.     

*fire_alt[]     -  This is the alternate array list of the sites of
                   every authorized person in the firewall.  Unless
                   allow_altsite is off, there MUST be a site listed
                   for EVERY user listed in *fire_name[]. The site can
                   be a DNS or a numeric IP.  Be careful with users who
                   have dynamic IPs.  If a user does NOT have an
                   alternate site, but you have allow_altsite on, there
                   MUST be something entered as the alternate site.
                   A recommended placeholder is "(none)".

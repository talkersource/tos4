SETTING UP THE DEFAULT INFORMATION

        The default and critical information about your TalkerBOT
        setup is located at the bottom of the TOS4SETUP.H file.
        These settings include the default bot name, the bot's
        trigger words, and the filename for each trigger.

   *BOT_def_name        - This sets the default username for the main
                          bot.  Since version 2.1, the bot code has
                          supported having multiple bots to choose from.
                          This will specify which one to load when a
                          name isn't given.  The first letter of the
                          bot's username MUST be capitalized.

   *BOT_triggers[]      - This is an array list of all the trigger words
                          that any of your talker's bots will respond
                          to.  If you modify this list, your talker will
                          have to be recompiled and rebooted before the
                          changes will take effect.  It is VERY IMPORTANT
                          that a '*' be the last item in this list.

   *BOT_trigger_files[] - This is an array list that contains the
                          filenames for each trigger listed in
                          *BOT_triggers[].  Order is important.  Each
                          trigger needs a filename listed for it.
                          There also MUST be a filename listed in the
                          same place as the '*' in the trigger array.
                          This particular file will be the response file
                          when someone says the bot's name, but does
                          not say a trigger.  THERE *MUST* BE A FILE
                          FOR EACH TRIGGER!


SETTING UP THE BOTFILES DIRECTORY

        There are 4 parts to the BOTFILES directory.

                - Bot information files.
                - Default trigger files.
                - Individual bot directories.
                - Individual bot trigger files.

        BOT INFORMATION FILES are used by the talker to determine which
        users are 'normal' and which are 'bots.'  When a bot is created
        using the .BOT CREATE command, the talker automatically creates
        a bot information file.  This file tells the talker that when
        someone uses .BOT LOAD, that this user is a bot.  When someone
        uses the .BOT DELETE command, the talker will automatically
        delete all normal userfiles and the bot information file for that
        particular bot.  In normal operation, it is NOT necessary to
        alter, create, or delete bot information files manually.

        DEFAULT TRIGGER FILES contain the default responses to each
        trigger.  The filenames defined in the .H file have .T added
        on to them--a trigger response filename would look like:

                Name entered in TOS4SETUP.H:  hello
                            Actual filename:  hello.T

     (See ADDING RESPONSES below for information on the response files.)

        INDIVIDUAL BOT DIRECTORIES are used to separate individual
        response files for each bot.  Version 2.3 of the bot code
        supports multiple bots. In order to establish different
        personalities for each bot, it is usually necessary to create
        different response files for many of the triggers for each
        bot.

                         Specific bot name:  Robot
                     Default bot directory:  tos4/botfiles/
           Specific bot response directory:  tos4/botfiles/Robot/


        INDIVIDUAL TRIGGER FILES are exactly the same as the default
        trigger files, but they are contained in the specific
        directory for that bot.  These are used to give each bot a
        different personality.  For example...

            Default directory: tos4/botfiles/
                
                     Bot name: Cop
                Bot directory: tos4/botfiles/Cop/

                     Bot name: Robber
                Bot directory: tos4/botfiles/Robber/

        You would naturally want these two bots to act and respond
        a bit differently from each other.  So the trigger files that
        are placed in the specific directories will be executed.  That
        way, Cop can be polite, and Robber can steal your wallet.  Also,
        if a specific response file (or the entire directory) cannot
        be found, the default files in the default directory is used.


ADDING RESPONSES to the TalkerBOT

        Each trigger must have an associated file.  Inside this file
        are two types of information:

                - The number of total RESPONSES in that file. (1st line)
                - Response codes. (remaining lines)

        There MUST be a number on the FIRST line of the file.  This number
        sets the total number of lines FOLLOWING the first line.  Do NOT
        leave blank lines in a response file.  Example:

                line 1: 3
                line 2: .hello %s!
                line 3: !Look!  %s is here!
                line 4: ,Did %s just come in?

        This would tell the talker there are a total of 3 responses to
        follow, and then the responses will be listed.  The talker will
        choose a random line to respond with.

    IMPORTANT:  The number on the first line MUST NOT be larger than the
                total number of responses, and there MUST NOT be any
                blank lines.  This may be different from other bot systems.

        Each response line BEGINS AT THE FAR LEFT MARGIN.  The first
        character of each line is a 'code' that tells the talker whether
        you wish the bot to SAY, SHOUT, THINK, or EMOTE the trigger and
        the first character will NOT be seen--it will be removed later.

           . = say         ; = emote       ! = shout       , = think

        In addition, each response may have UP TO ONE 'code' to determine
        where the user's name is placed.  This is not required, but there
        can NOT be more than one.  The symbol is '%s'.  Wherever the
        symbol is placed will determine the insert point.  It *is*
        possible to have a trigger without a name placeholder.  It is NOT
        necessary to append a '\n' to the end of each line as this will
        be done automatically by the talker.


OPERATING THE ONLINE BOT

        All bot functions are controlled by the .bot command.

                Syntax:   .bot [<command>] [<parameters>]

        Using the .bot command by itself will list out all available
        bot commands.  Some bot commands require parameters to follow
        them, others do not.  Most bot action commands such as SAY,
        EMOTE, and SHOUT are self-explanitory, so only the specific
        ones will be listed here.

        HELP    - This will list basic operation instructions.
        CREATE  - This will create a new bot.
                  This requires parameter:  <NewBotName>
        LOAD    - This will load the default bot, or it will load
                  a specific bot if the <BotName> parameter is used.
        UNLOAD  - This will unload the current bot.
        DELETE  - This will delete the bot named by <BotName>
        LTRIG   - This will display the current trigger list.

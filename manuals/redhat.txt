T a l k e r O S         public release                  version 4.03
====================================================================

This file is only needed if you are planning to run TalkerOS on a
Linux box using the Red Hat release of Linux.

The following libraries have conflicts with RedHat:

	stdio.h

The following libraries have been included to patch these problems:

	tos4_stdio.h

To correct the conflict, open the file:  tos403.c
Find the line that says:  #include <stdio.h>
Change this linke to:     #include "tos4_stdio.h"
Save the tos403.c file.


Also, some versions of RedHat have an incompatible CRYPT module.
To fix this problem...

        Instead of using:    cc tos403.c -o tos4
                     Use:    cc tos403.c -lcrypt -o tos4


These are all the RedHat issuses known to me to-date.  I am
working to correct compatibility issues in version 5.0.

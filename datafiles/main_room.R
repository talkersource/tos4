This is the main room of the talker.
This description file is in ./datafiles/main_room.R

You can edit it from the shell, or the talker command .rmdesc
if you have the Room-Edit attribute set in your userfile.
When shipped, the user 'Admin' has this bit set.  To give
others permission to this feature, set the last '0' on the
line that begins with their userlevel to '1'.

See  .map  for more rooms, or type  .exits  for this room's links.
